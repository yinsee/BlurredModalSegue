# BlurredModalSegue

Select Custom Segue and select BlurredModalSegue

Improved over https://github.com/AlvaroFranco/AFBlurSegue/, which is not working correctly if your destinationViewController is a UITableViewController.

This class detects the destination controller type and correctly insert the effect as subView or backgroundView.

To further customize the effect, explore the code!

cheers! ;)
